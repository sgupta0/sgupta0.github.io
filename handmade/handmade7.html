    <p> I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of
resistance </p>

<p> In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and
digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish
experimental web art and writing projects. </p>

<p> The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I
am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways. </p>
