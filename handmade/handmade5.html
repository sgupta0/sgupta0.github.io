    <p>I evoke the term <a href="handmade6.html">'handmade web'</a> in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run. </p>

<p> For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers. </p>

<p> In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called Unindexed which continuously
searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can
create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it. </p>

<p> Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfortâ€™s Taroko Gorge (2008). For
many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text. </p>

<p> I have rewritten Taroko Gorge three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first
iteration, Gorge (2010), were published in my very small press print
book GENERATION[S] (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. Gorge is a
never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
on food, consumption, decadence, and desire. </p>
