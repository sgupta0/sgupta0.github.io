<p id="bodytext"><span id="underline">I evoke</span> the term <a href="handmade1.html">“handmade web” </a>  in order to draw attention to the physical body.</p>

<p id="bodytext">Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's <a href="https://www.onemilescroll.com/" target="_blank">The One Mile
Scroll</a> (2008) A few entries appear at the top of the screen—Denver, The Mile High City—my
grandfather’s grave, Denver—after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through
the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
physical distance. </p>

<p id="bodytext">Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. <a href="https://theliteraryplatform.com/news/2014/08/from-the-digital-to-the-bookbound/" target="_blank">In Reading Writing
Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound</a> (2014), Lori Emerson argues: </p>
<p id="indented"> “The iPad works
because users can’t know how it works” (15). </p>

<p id="bodytext"> Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar
device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides
consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the
handcrafting of new materials. </p>

<p id="bodytext"><span id="underline">I evoke</span> the term “handmade web” to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of
resistance. </p>

<p id="bodytext"> In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and
digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish
experimental web art and writing projects. </p>

<p id="bodytext">The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I
am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways. </p>
