    <p> I evoke the term <a href="handmade5.html">'handmade web'</a> in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement
with the making of web pages and of web policies. </p>

<p> In The Web We Lost (2012), Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a
broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." </p>

<p> In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
headline: Millions of Facebook users have no idea theyâ€™re using the internet. As the article
states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves." </p>

<p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0
Revival. Its author Kyle Chayka observed: </p>

<p>The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
everything was smaller...</p>

<p> The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
network TILDE.CLUB, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art
work 640x480 - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>

<p> In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. My own website,
including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
HomeSite in 1997. </p>

<p> Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive Ubu Web site,
an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still
hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996." </p>

<p> I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool. </p>
