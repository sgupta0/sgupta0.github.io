        <p id="bodytext">In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. My own website,
        including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
        HomeSite in 1997. </p>

        <p id="bodytext"> Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive Ubu Web site,
        an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
        arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still
        hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996." </p>

        <p id="bodytext">I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool. </p>

        <p id="bodytext"><span id="underline">I evoke</span> the term <a href="handmade4.html">“handmade web”</a> in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
        involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
        “manual”, a “handbook”, a set of instructions required for a computer program to run. </p>

        <p id="bodytext"> For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
        have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
        and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers. </p>

        <p id="bodytext">In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called <a href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed" target="_blank">Unindexed</a> which continuously
        searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
        permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the<a href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed" target="_blank"> source code on GitHub</a>, so you too can
        create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it. </p>

        <p id="bodytext">Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort’s <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/" target="_blank">Taroko Gorge</a> (2008). For
        many, this was their first experience “making” a computer-generated text. </p>

        <p id="bodytext">I have rewritten <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/" target="_blank">Taroko Gorge</a> three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
        web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first
        iteration, <a href="https://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html" target="_blank">Gorge</a> (2010), were published in my very small press print
        book <a href="https://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html" target="blank">GENERATION[S]</a> (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. <a href="https://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html" target="_blank">Gorge</a> is a
        never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
        on food, consumption, decadence, and desire. </p>
